Week 5 Homework

Basic Assignment User Story

I created a basic trivia game with a music theme. Each question is followed by four possible choices - the player should not be able to pick more than one answer.

The player has a limited amount of time (120 seconds) to answer each question. When the player presses the start button, a timer will appear signaling how much time the player has remaining. If time runs out before the player has a chance to answer all the questions, the game will end and the player will be shown his/her results.

The results will summarize:
  Number of questions answered correctly,
  Number of questions answered incorrectly,
  Number of questions that were left unanswered.

The player can choose to end the game early by pressing the submit button, thus immediately taking the player to the results page.
